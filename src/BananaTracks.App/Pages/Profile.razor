<h2>About</h2>

<p>BananaTracks was designed and developed by me, <a href="https://andy.mehalick.com">Andy Mehalick</a>. I wanted a replacement for a few practice tracking apps that have too many ads, a paid subscription model, or not quite the right features and customization options.</p>

<p>BananaTracks is completely free-to-use and open-source; it doesn't track, collect, share, or resell any personal information.</p>
